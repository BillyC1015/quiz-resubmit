# quiz with Timer
For this project I had to construct a quiz with a timer

I used javascript elements to make click events
Created questions and was able to make the original rules box disappear at the click of the start button. 
Unfortunately was not able to get very far with this one, it was very tricky for me


GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
